:pencil: Description

This data originally came from [Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone).

Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

It contains whether the sentiment of the tweets in this set was positive, neutral, or negative for six US airlines.
